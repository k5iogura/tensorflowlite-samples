# NumPy-CNN
A convolutional neural network fully implemented using NumPy

### Requirements:
- NumPy (obviously)

### Additional Requirements (Only the data loader part):
- TensorFlow Contrib (To download and train on MNIST data)
- keras.utils (To convert labels to one-hot)

Of course, the CNN is built without using these.
Execute using `python numpy_cnn.py`
